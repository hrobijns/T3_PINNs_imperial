# Geometric analysis with machine learning: summer project with Imperial College, London
Summer project in collaboration with Meg Dearden-Hellawell, supervised by Daniel Platt (Imperial College, London, maths department) and Daattavya Argarwal (Cambridge University, computer science department). This repository concerns the second of two projects, focusing on using PINNs to find a harmonic-one form on the three torus for different metrics.

## Packages and requirements:
- Python
- TensorFlow

## Contents:
##### requirements.txt:
- text file containing required software to run files in this repository.

### Pre-project work:

##### simple_PINN.py:
- implementing a simple physics informed neural network, as in [this paper (1)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10561), as an eductional exercise.

### Project: Harmonic 1-forms on T<sup>3</sup>
Does there exist a metric on the 3-dimensional torus T<sup>3</sup> such that every harmonic 1-form has a vanishing zero?

##### T3_PINN.py:
- in progress
